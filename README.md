## 📖 Chapter 4 Summary – Whispers in the Walls

Chapter 4 picks up immediately after Lina’s punishment and the haunting discovery of a cryptic message in Chapter 3. The environment inside the Shelter becomes tenser than ever — trust is scarce, and paranoia is rising.

### 🔑 Key Moments:

* **The “Silent Girl” finally speaks**: The mysterious girl who had been silent in previous chapters reveals her name: *Mira*. She shares fragmented memories that hint the Shelter might be **a government experiment or punishment system**.
* **Eon disappears briefly**, causing suspicion. When he returns, he is bloodied and shaken but refuses to say what happened.
* **A hidden panel is discovered** behind a rusted wall by Lina. Inside is a camera… already broken — meaning **someone else had already tried to escape or sabotage the system**.
* One of the “guards” — faceless, in full-body armor — **makes a mistake and speaks emotionally**, breaking the illusion that they are mindless enforcers. This creates a theory: **they may be former prisoners**.
